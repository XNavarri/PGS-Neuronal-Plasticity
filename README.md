# PGS-Neuronal-Plasticity

Using Gene Ontology, we first identified 199 genes implicated in neuronal plasticity, which mapped to 155,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 
Second, we estimated their effect sizes from an educational attainment meta-GWAS (PMC6393768) to build a PGS-NP.
Third, we weighted the SNPs that intersected with the summary statistics of meta-GWAS on educational attainment, which yielded a list of 40,804 SNPs to which an effect
size could be assigned and used in the computation of the polygenic scores of neuronal plasticity (PGS-NP).
